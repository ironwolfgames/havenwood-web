# Houses of Havenwood — Rulebook

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Havenwood**, an ancient woodland realm protected for centuries by four great animal houses. Now, a magical phenomenon known as the **Aether Storm** threatens to overwhelm the land with chaotic energy.

**Houses of Havenwood** is a cooperative, asymmetric game for 1-4 players. You take on the roles of the **Squirrels**, **Foxes**, **Owls**, and **Badgers**. You must work together to survive the storm, repel threats, and complete a monumental **Great Work** to save your home.

## 2. Objective

**To Win:**
The players must complete **one Great Work** (consisting of all its components) before a loss condition is met.

**To Lose:**
The players lose immediately if **any** of the following occur:

1. The **Storm Track** reaches the final space (Storm Climax).
2. Any single House has **all its buildings destroyed**.
3. The **Event Deck** runs out of cards.

## 3. Setup

### A. Global Setup

1. **Map**: Place the **Central Havenwood** tile in the center of the table. Shuffle the **Hex Tile Deck** and place it face down.

1. **Tracks**:
  a. Place the **Threat/Storm Track Board**. Set the Storm Marker to the start (0).
  a. Place the **Tech & Magic Tree Board**. Set Knowledge and Insight markers to 0.
5. **Great Work**: Choose one **Great Work** (e.g., *Heart of the Wood*) and place its **Component Cards** face up near the board.

### B. Player Setup

1. Each player chooses a **House** and takes the corresponding **Player Mat** and **House Marker**.
1. Place your House Marker on the **Central Havenwood** tile.

---

## 5. Phase 1: Strategy

1. **Draw**: All players draw cards from their personal deck up to their current **Hand Limit** (Default: 5).
  a. *If your deck runs out, shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck.*
1. **Pass**: Each player may pass **one card** from their hand to a neighbor (players decide direction: left or right). This allows you to give critical actions (like "Build" or "Main Action") to the player who needs them most.

---

## 6. Phase 2: Action

Players take their turns simultaneously or in any order they choose. Cooperation is key! You play cards from your hand to perform actions.

### Basic Actions (Available to All)

- **Build**: Construct or upgrade a building on the **Hex Tile** occupied by your House Marker.
  - Pay the resource cost listed on your Player Mat.
  - Max **one building** per hex.
- **Move**: Move your House Marker to an adjacent hex.
  - **Level 1 Move**: Move up to 1 space.
  - **Level 2 Move**: Move up to 2 spaces.

  - Pay the **Food** cost listed on the card.

*(See "House Guides" below for details)*

  a. Spaces 13–14: Draw **3** Cards
  a. Space 15: **GAME OVER**
1. **Resolve Events**: Draw cards one by one and resolve them.
  a. **Vulnerability Check**: Does the event target a specific environment (e.g., Forest)? It only triggers if a player/building is on that tile type.
  a. **Defense**: Can the **Foxes** negate it?
    - *Walls/Fortifications*: Compare Wall Level vs. Event Severity.
    - *Magic Shield*: Negates Aether events.
  a. **Effect**: If not defended, apply the penalty (lose resources, destroy building, etc.).
  a. **Storm Cards**: If the card is a Storm Card, advance the **Storm Marker** on the track.
