Asymmetric co-op turn-based web game

## Game Core

- *Type:* Turn-based, web-based, co-op board game/sim hybrid.
- *Theme:* Whimsical fantasy land with anthropomorphic creatures.
- *Player Role:* Rulers of asymmetric factions/kingdoms.
- *Gameplay:* Systems/resource management (not tactical unit movement).
- *Turn Structure:* Simultaneous planning → single resolution phase.
- *Turn Length:* 2–5 mins of choices → ~60–90 min session.
- *Win/Loss:* Each faction has a unique mini-goal + shared project; group loses if survival thresholds fail.
- *Modes:* Co-op primary, solo with AI or single-faction possible.

## Shared Projects

### 1. The Great Sky Lantern
  
- *Theme:* A massive floating lantern powered by magic and resources, meant to banish the encroaching darkness.
- *Gameplay:* Requires steady contributions of food (fuel), magic research, crafted parts, and defenses against nighttime threats.
- *Victory Condition:* Launch the lantern before the final turn — it illuminates the entire land, driving back the darkness.

### 2. The Heartwood Tree
- *Theme:* An ancient tree at the center of the land that has withered; players must restore it.
- *Gameplay:* Each round, factions can contribute resources, magic, and blessings to heal different parts of the tree (roots, trunk, branches).
- *Victory Condition:* Fully restore the tree before it collapses, symbolizing life and balance returning to the land.

### 3. The Crystal Bridge
- *Theme:* A massive magical bridge that will connect the fractured lands and unite the kingdoms.
- *Gameplay:* Constructed in stages — requires building materials (otters), magical stabilizers (starlings), protection during construction (badgers), and supply lines (moles + foxes).
- *Victory Condition:* Complete all bridge segments before the final turn, allowing the kingdoms to be connected.

### 4. The Moon Temple
- *Theme:* A forgotten temple must be rebuilt and reawakened to seal away a chaotic force rising each night.
- *Gameplay:* Requires both construction (builders), ritual offerings (providers), arcane knowledge (mystics), and defense during rituals (guardians).
- *Victory Condition:* Complete all temple chambers and perform the final sealing ritual on the last turn.

### 5. The Skyship Ark
- *Theme:* A wondrous flying ship that can carry the factions to safety beyond the stormlands.
- *Gameplay:* Multi-step construction: hull (builders), sails/rigging (explorers), energy crystals (mystics), food stores (providers), defenses against raiders (guardians).
- *Victory Condition:* Launch the ship before the land is overrun, allowing the players to escape together.

### Design Notes

Each project can be modularized into stages, so every faction has clear contributions (e.g., Stage 1: foundation, Stage 2: power, Stage 3: final ritual/launch). Projects provide tension: players must divert resources between their faction goals, the shared project, and ongoing survival threats.

### How Shared Projects Could Work

#### 1. Project Selection Timing
  
- *Option A:* Chosen at the start of the game, players know their mission from turn 1.
- *Option B:* Chosen mid-game (say, around turn 3–4 of a 7-turn game) after players see how their kingdoms are developing. This creates drama: “We’re clearly great at farming this run — let’s restore the Heartwood Tree!”

#### 2. Project Structure

Each project could be broken into 3 stages, where each stage requires contributions from all factions:

- Example: *Skyship Ark*
  - Stage 1: Gather hull materials (builders, providers).
  - Stage 2: Power the engines and sails (mystics, explorers).
  - Stage 3: Defend the launch and stock supplies (guardians, providers).

Each stage could also come with unique events tied to the project:
- Heartwood Tree → “Root Blight” events.
- Sky Lantern → “Darkness Encroaches” events.
- Moon Temple → “Unstable Ritual” events.

#### 3. Replayability & Balance

- Having 4–6 possible projects (like the ones we sketched: Lantern, Heartwood, Bridge, Temple, Ark) would give players lots of variety.
- Each project subtly shifts the weight of importance between factions, ensuring that different sessions feel fresh.
